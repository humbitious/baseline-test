# Welcome

## Welcome to the Baseline Protocol Community

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020 and launched as an [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/) open source project on \[ March X, 2020 \], supported by fourteen founding companies: [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/blockchain), EY, [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), [Core Convergence](https://www.coreconvergence.us/), ConsenSys, [Duke University](https://pratt.duke.edu/), [Envision Blockchain](https://envisionblockchain.com/), [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/), Microsoft, [Neocova](https://neocova.com/), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), [Unibright](https://unibright.io/), [Provide](https://provide.services/), and [W3BCLOUD](https://www.w3bcloud.com/). 

The work of the community is maintained under public domain license CC0-Universal at [https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline). Here you will find three things:

* The code of a procurement demo called Radish34, which led to the formation of the Baseline Protocol initiative. 
* A folder that will contain the specifications, reference code and other material constituting the Baseline Protocol as the community derives it from the initial Radish34 proof of concept. 
* Issues the community will write and use to propose, prioritize and organize work. 
* Lots of opportunities to get informed, get involved, and get value out of defining requirements, developing reusable components, and ultimately deploying the Baseline Protocol in your own offerings.

## The Baseline Protocol

The Baseline Protocol is:

* An approach to using the public [Mainnet](baseline-basics/glossary.md#mainnet) as a common frame of reference between corporate systems of record, one that makes sense to security and performance-minded technology officers.  
* An architecture that helps reduce overheads and increase operational integrity when automating business processes across multiple companies.
