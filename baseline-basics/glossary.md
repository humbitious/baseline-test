## Baseline Protocol

A set of components and procedures that allows separate systems of record to maintain record consistency and workflow integrity by using the public Ethereum Mainnet as a common frame of reference \(CFR\). 

## **Mainnet**

The Mainnet is an always-on state machine that is maintained as a public good in such a way that it maximizes the resistance to an individual or group to gain control, lock out users from valid functions, or change history. The Mainnet is capitalized to emphasize its relationship to the Internet.   
  
Used without capitalization to distinguish a public production network from public testnets. For example, the Ethereum mainnet vs. its testnets, such as Ropsten.
